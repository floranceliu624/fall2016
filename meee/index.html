     <h2>Junior in Graphic Design </h2>
     <p>My goal is to learn the basics of coding/web designing and create a professional portfolio. </p>
     <p>The web plays a large part of my career because there are almost everything in graphic design that has a relation to the tech world. A great way to organize my work and to showcase them.</p>
     <p>I hope to create a website to showcase a professional portfolio of my Graphic Design side and also branding an art/fashion/lifestyle online magazine/blog </p>
